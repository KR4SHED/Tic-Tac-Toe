# Tic Tac Toe

I am trying to learn pygame and this is my first step to making video games. This is my first game without any tutorials or guides.

## How To Run?
First [download](https://github.com/KR4SHED/Tic-Tac-Toe/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the project.

Next to run this project you have to download the project here or by using git clone.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KR4SHED/Tic-Tac-Toe
```

Once you have downloaded that get pygame or pygame-ce which can be installed with pip. What pip version are you running? idk figure it out yourslef. But for me I would run

```bash
  pip3 install pygame-ce
```

or

```bash
  pip3 install pygame
```

I prefer pygame-ce because it gets more updates and is open source but it really doesn't matter I don't think so at least. 

Ok once you are done that open the game.py file and open with python launcher or if you want to do it in terminal cd to the file for example

```bash
  cd downloads/Tic-Tac-Toe-main

  python3 game.py
```

Ok enjoy my trashy game!!!! üëç
